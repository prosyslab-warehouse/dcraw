   This is a portable ANSI C program to convert raw image files from
   any digital camera into PPM format.  TIFF and CIFF parsing are
   based upon public specifications, but no such documentation is
   available for the raw sensor data, so writing this program has
   been an immense effort.

   This code is freely licensed for all uses, commercial and
   otherwise.  Comments, questions, and encouragement are welcome.
