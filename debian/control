Description: decode raw digital camera images
 This utility converts the native (RAW), format of various digital
 cameras into netpbm portable pixmap (.ppm) image.  Supports the
 following models: Canon, Kodak, Olympus, Nikon, Fuji, Minolta and
 Sigma (see http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ for full list)
 Note: This utility does not read directly from the cameras, only
 the files after they have been downloaded, use gphoto2 for that.
