dcraw for Debian
----------------

I personally have a Canon EOS 10D and have found the output from
dcraw comparable to software supplied by canon (which is for
windows only of course).
Typically, dcraw produces improved contrast images making better
use of the available dynamic range.

There is also a plugin for the gimp to read raw images directly.
