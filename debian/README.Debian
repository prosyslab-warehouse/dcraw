I personally have a Canon EOS 10D and have found the output from
dcraw comparable to software supplied by Canon (which is for
windows only of course).
Typically, I have found, dcraw produces improved contrast images
making better use of the available dynamic range.

There is also a plugin for the gimp to read raw images directly.
